/*Cow implements FarmObject
Fields
•	String for name
•	int for level of hungriness
•	int for age
•	int sicknessLevel

Behavior:
•	From 6AM to 6PM, a cow traverses one square in a random direction each hour. 
•	If the chosen square is occupied by something that is not grass or the cow would go off the grid, do nothing for that hour.
•	At any other time, the cow is asleep, and does nothing.
•	If the cow attempts to move to a square filled with grass, the grass is removed, the cow’s hungriness decreases by the amount of grass, and the cow moves to the square.
•	Every hour, the cow's hungriness level increases by 2 and age by 1.	
•	If hungriness level reaches 100 or age reaches 90001, the cow dies and is removed from the farm.
•	Cow has a (0.0001*age*sicknessLevel)% chance of dying each hour. Dead cows are removed from the farm.
